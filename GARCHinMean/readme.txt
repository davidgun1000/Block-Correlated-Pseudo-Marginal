This MATLAB software implements the multiple PMMH methods for the multivariate stochastic volatility in mean modelfrom the paper "The Block-Correlated Pseudo Marginal Sampler for State Space Models".The main programs are:1) ParPMMH_appr1_2575_Diffusion: the main code for implementing MPM with 25% trimmed mean.2) ParPMMH_appr1_median_Diffusion: the main code for implementing MPM with 50% trimmed mean.
