This MATLAB software implements the multiple PMMH methods for the medium scale DSGE modelfrom the paper "The Block-Correlated Pseudo Marginal Sampler for State Space Models".The main programs are:1) ParPMMH_appr1_median: the main code for implementing MPM with 50% trimmed mean. The measurement error variances are estimated.2) ParPMMH_appr1_median_fixedmea025: the main code for implementing MPM with 50% trimmed mean. The measurement error variances are fixed at 25% sample variance of the observables.3) ParPMMH_appr1_median_fixedmea025_SW: the main code for implementing MPM with 50% trimmed mean for the extended model. The measurement error variances are fixed at 25% sample variance of the observables.4) CorrPMMH_medscale_fixedmea025: the main code for implementing correlated PMMH. The measurement error variances are fixed at 25% sample variance of the observables.5) CorrPMMH_medscale: the main code for implementing correlated PMMH. The measurement error variances are estimated.
