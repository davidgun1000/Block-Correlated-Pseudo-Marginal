This MATLAB software implements the multiple PMMH methods for the small scale DSGE modelfrom the paper "The Block-Correlated Pseudo Marginal Sampler for State Space Models".The main programs are:1) ParPMMH_appr1: the main code for implementing MPM with 0% trimmed mean.2) ParPMMH_appr1_0109: the main code for implementing MPM with 10% trimmed mean.3) ParPMMH_appr1_2575: the main code for implementing MPM with 25% trimmed mean.4) ParPMMH_appr1_2575_nocorr: the main code for implementing MPM with 25% trimmed mean with rho_u=0.5) ParPMMH_appr1_2575_DA: the main code for implementing delayed acceptance MPM with 25% trimmed mean.6) ParPMMH_appr1_median: the main code for implementing MPM with 50% trimmed mean.7) ParPMMH_appr1_bootstrap: the main code for implementing MPM with 0% trimmed mean with bootstrap filter.8) CorrPMMH_bootstrap: the main code for implementing correlated PMMH.
