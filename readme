This MATLAB software implements the multiple PMMH methods from the paper "The Block-Correlated Pseudo Marginal Sampler for State Space Models".
There are four examples in the model.
1) Linear Gaussian State Space Model
2) Multivariate stochastic volatility in the mean model
3) Small Scale DSGE model
4) Medium Scale DSGE model
The examples are organised in separate folders.
Each folder has a folder ("results") containing all the results for that example. 
For the DSGE examples, you need to install dynare from https://www.dynare.org/
I use dynare version 4.5.7.
