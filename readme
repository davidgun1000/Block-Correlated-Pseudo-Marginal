This MATLAB package implements the multiple pseudo-marginal (PMMH) methods described in the paper:

"The Block-Correlated Pseudo Marginal Sampler for State Space Models"
David Gunawan, Probal Chatterjee, and Robert Kohn.

📦 Included Examples
The package includes four fully worked examples, each located in its own folder:

Linear Gaussian State Space Model

Multivariate Stochastic Volatility in the Mean Model

Small-Scale DSGE Model

Medium-Scale DSGE Model

Each example folder contains a subfolder named results/, where the corresponding output and results are saved after running the model.

⚙️ Requirements for DSGE Models
For the DSGE examples, you must install Dynare.
The code was tested with Dynare version 4.5.7, which can be downloaded from:

Please refer to the paper for detailed methodology, algorithmic structure, and theoretical background.
