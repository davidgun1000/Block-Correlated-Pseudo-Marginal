This MATLAB software implements the multiple PMMH methods for the linear Gaussian state space modelfrom the paper "The Block-Correlated Pseudo Marginal Sampler for State Space Models".The main programs are:1) ParPMMH_appr1_LGSS: the main code for implementing MPM with 0% trimmed mean. 2) ParPMMH_appr1_595_LGSS: the main code for implementing MPM with 5% trimmed mean. 3) ParPMMH_appr1_595_LGSS_nocorr: the main code for implementing MPM (no blocking) with 5% trimmed mean.4) ParPMMH_appr1_1090_LGSS: the main code for implementing MPM with 10% trimmed mean.5) ParPMMH_appr1_1090_LGSS_nocorr: the main code for implementing MPM (no blocking) with 10% trimmed mean.6) ParPMMH_appr1_2575_LGSS: the main code for implementing MPM with 25% trimmed mean.7) ParPMMH_appr1_2575_LGSS_nocorr: the main code for implementing MPM (no blocking_ with 25% trimmed mean.8) CorrPMMH_LGSS: the main code for implementing correlated PMMH9) CorrPMMH_LGSS_DE: the main code for implementing correlated PMMH with Hilbert Sorting.
